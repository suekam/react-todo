# React todo list

This is a single-page responsive website that displays trello-inspired todo list powered by React.

You can add multiple checklists to the page. You can also edit checklist name and delete list. For each todo item, you can pin them on top, edit, delete or add a sub-list for the item. Done items automatically sink to the bottom.
